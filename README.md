# Learning Chatbot by Kirklen Allen

Welcome to the **Learning Chatbot**, a Python-based conversational agent that grows smarter with every interaction. This project represents my continued journey and expansion as a **Senior Year Computer Science Software Engineering student**, combining foundational programming principles with the capability of creating adaptive and interactive AI systems.

## Overview

The Learning Chatbot is a lightweight program designed to interact with users, learn from their responses, and expand its conversational abilities over time. It stores user-input data in a memory file (`chatbot_memory.json`) to ensure it retains knowledge even after restarting.

## Features

- **Dynamic Learning**: The chatbot adapts by learning new responses directly from user input.
- **Memory Persistence**: Stores learned responses in a JSON file for future interactions.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides clear prompts and conversational engagement.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and unforeseen scenarios.
- **Interactive**: Users can teach the bot how to respond to new phrases in real time.

## Installation

To run this chatbot on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A7X-lab/Python-Artifact-7-Chatbot.git
